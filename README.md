# Spaces

Spaces is a permanent and secure password manager built on [Arweave](https://www.arweave.org/).

> Spaces is still in early development. Do not store important or sensible data!

## How does it work?

Your Arweave private key is used to encrypt, sign and ultimately store your secrets on the Arweave. Spaces is completely decentralised with everything happening inside your browser. Even the Spaces app itself is stored on the Arweave and will stay there. Forever.
